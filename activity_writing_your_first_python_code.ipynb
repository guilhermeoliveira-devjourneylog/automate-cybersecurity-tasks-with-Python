    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language that helps in automating instructions to the computer in a variety of contexts, including security contexts. Writing code in Python is a valuable skill that helps security analysts thrive in their technical work.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll practice writing your first Python code while learning about a notebook environment. The hands-on practice you engage in throughout the labs will help you apply Python coding skills to your work as a security analyst. You'll benefit the most from the labs if you make sure to not only write in the cells that you're prompted to fill in, but also analyze all the cells thoroughly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary><h2>Tips for completing this lab</h2></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you navigate this lab, keep the following tips in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` indicates where you should write code. Be sure to replace this with your own code before running the code cell.\n",
    "- Feel free to open the hints for additional guidance as you work on each task. \n",
    "- To enter your answer to a question, double-click the markdown cell to edit. Be sure to replace the \"[Double-click to enter your responses here.]\" with your own answer.\n",
    "- You can save your work manually by clicking File and then Save in the menu bar at the top of the notebook. \n",
    "- You can download your work locally by clicking File and then Download and then specifying your preferred file format in the menu bar at the top of the notebook. \n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "As a security analyst, you'll often use notebook environments and notebooks to write and run code. This lab will help you get familiar with working in a notebook environment, writing code comments in Python, and displaying strings with the `print()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll complete a series of tasks that involve observing and running some pre-written cells of text and code, as well as filling in cells with your own text, Python code, and code comments. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab environment you're working in is a notebook-based coding environment. Notebooks, such as this one, consist of two types of cells: (1) text cells, also known as markdown cells, and (2) code cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells allow you to write plain text and format it in the markdown language. Markdown language is used for formatting plain text in text editors and code editors. For example, you can use markdown to make headers, bold or italicize words, format text as code, add hyperlinks,  and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, write something into the following markdown cell. Be sure to replace the \"[Double-click to edit this markdown cell and write something here.]\" with your own statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a markdown cell, and you can write text in here. \n",
    "\n",
