    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables help security analysts to keep track of a variety of security-related information. For example, analysts may need to create Python variables for the users who are allowed to log in, the number of login attempts that they're permitted, and the current number of attempts that a user has made.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll practice assigning values to variables and determining their data types.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` indicates where you should write code. Be sure to replace this with your own code before running the code cell.\n",
    "- Feel free to open the hints for additional guidance as you work on each task.\n",
    "- To enter your answer to a question, double-click the markdown cell to edit. Be sure to replace the \"[Double-click to enter your responses here.]\" with your own answer.\n",
    "- You can save your work manually by clicking File and then Save in the menu bar at the top of the notebook.\n",
    "- You can download your work locally by clicking File and then Download and then specifying your preferred file format in the menu bar at the top of the notebook.\n",

    "## Scenario\n",
    "You are a security analyst who is responsible for writing code that will automate analysis of login attempts made to a specific device. As the first step, you'll need to create variables to keep track of information relevant to the login process. This information includes the device ID, list of approved usernames, maximum login attempts allowed per user, current login attempts made by a user, and login status.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this lab, you'll assign these variables and check the data types of the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1\n",
    "In your work as an analyst, imagine there is a device only users specified on an allow list can access, and its device ID is `\"72e08x0\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code cell, assign this value to a variable named `device_id`. Then display the contents of the variable and observe the output.  \n",
    "\n",

In other words, the current number of log in attempts the user has made has exceeded the maximum number of attempts allowed.\n",

    "- There are many useful operators in Python that help you work with variables.\n",
    "  - The `=` assignment operator allows you to assign or reassign a specific value to a variable.\n",
    "  - The `<=` comparison operator allows you to compare the value of one variable to the value of another.\n",
    "- The `type()` function in Python helps you to determine the data type of an object.\n",
    "  - If you pass in a variable to `type()`, it will output the data type of the value stored in the variable.\n",
    "- The `print()` function in Python allows you to display information.\n",
    "  - It can take in a value directly, a variable that stores a value, or a comparison between variables that evaluates to a Boolean value."
