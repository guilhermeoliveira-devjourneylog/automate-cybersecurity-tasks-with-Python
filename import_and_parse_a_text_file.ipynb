    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Security logs are often stored in text files. To analyze the security logs in these files, security analysts have to import and parse these files. Python has some functions that come in handy for these tasks, allowing analysts to efficiently access information from text files. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll practice using functions and other syntax in Python to import and parse text files. \n",

    "<details><summary><h2>Tips for completing this lab</h2></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you navigate this lab, keep the following tips in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` indicates where you should write code. Be sure to replace this with your own code before running the code cell.\n",
    "- Feel free to open the hints for additional guidance as you work on each task. \n",
    "- To enter your answer to a question, double-click the markdown cell to edit. Be sure to replace the \"[Double-click to enter your responses here.]\" with your own answer.\n",
    "- You can save your work manually by clicking File and then Save in the menu bar at the top of the notebook. \n",
    "- You can download your work locally by clicking File and then Download and then specifying your preferred file format in the menu bar at the top of the notebook. \n",
    "</details>\n",

    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you're working as a security analyst. You're responsible for preparing a security log file for analysis and creating a text file with IP addresses that are allowed to access restricted information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1\n",
    "In this task, you'll import a security log text file and store it as a string to prepare it for analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a `with` statement is often used in file handling to open a file and then automatically close the file after reading it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're given a variable named `import_file` that contains the name of the log file that you want to import. Start by writing the first line of the `with` statement in the following code cell. Use the `open()` function, setting the second parameter to `\"r\"`. Note that running this code will produce an error because it will only contain the first line of the `with` statement; you'll complete this `with` statement in the task after this. Be sure to replace the `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code.\n"

    "**What are your key takeaways from this lab?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python has functions and syntax that help you import and parse text files.\n",
    "  - The `with` statement allows you to efficiently handle files.\n",
    "  - The `open()` function allows you to import or open a file. It takes in the name of the file as the first parameter and a string that indicates the purpose of opening the file as the second parameter.\n",
    "    - Specify `\"r\"` as the second parameter if you're opening the file for reading purposes.\n",
    "    - Specify `\"a\"` as the second parameter if you're opening the file for appending purposes.\n",
    "    - Specify `\"w\"` as the second parameter if you're opening the file for writing purposes.\n",
    "  - The `.read()` method allows you to read in a file. \n",
    "  - The `.write()` method allows you to append or write to a file.\n",
    "- The `.split()` method in Python allows you to convert a string to a list."
