# automate-cybersecurity-tasks-with-Python
 This repository is dedicated to my learning of Python applied to cybersecurity. It covers the basic concepts of Python, such as data types, variables, conditional and iterative statements, as well as expanding my knowledge with pre-built and user-defined functions, and how modules provide access to reusable code. Additionally, it focuses on working with strings and lists, writing algorithms, and using regular expressions to search for patterns. The culmination is the practical application of Python in automating cybersecurity-related tasks, such as opening, reading, and structuring file content, as well as code debugging strategies.
