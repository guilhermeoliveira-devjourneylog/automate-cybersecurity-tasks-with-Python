    "Built-in functions are functions that exist within Python and can be called directly. They help analysts efficiently complete tasks. Python also supports user-defined functions. These are functions that analysts write for their specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, patterns in login attempts could reveal suspicious activity. Python functions can help analysts work efficiently with lists of login attempts. Both built-in functions and user-defined functions in Python can help security analysts analyze login attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll use built-in functions to work with a list of failed login attempts per month to prepare it for further analysis, and you'll define a function that compares the user's login attempts for the current day to their average number of login attempts.\n",

    "## Scenario\n",
    "In your work as a security analyst, you're responsible for working with a list that contains the number of failed attempts that occurred each month. You'll identify any patterns that might indicate malicious activity. You're also responsible for defining a function that compares the logins for the current day to an average and improving it by adding a `return` statement.\n",

    "`119`, `101`, `99`, `91`, `92`, `105`, `108`, `85`, `88`, `90`, `264`, and `223`.\n",

    "This list is organized in chronological order of months (January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December).\n",
    "\n",
    "This list is stored in a variable named `failed_login_list`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, use a built-in Python function to order the list. You'll pass the call to the function that sorts the list directly into the `print()` function. This will allow you to display and examine the result.\n",

    "- There are a variety of ways a function can be written. \n",
    "  - It can be written to display information to the screen, or return information that can then be saved in a variable.\n",
    "  - Also it can be written to take in any number of parameters, use the parameters to execute a series of tasks, and then return a result.\n",
    "- The `sorted()` function in Python is a built-in function that helps you sort the components of a list.\n",
    "  - For example, when you call `sorted()` with a list of numbers, it returns the list with the elements in numerical order. \n",
    "- The `max()` function in Python is a built-in function that helps you identify the element with the maximum value in a list. \n",
    "  - For example, when you call `max()` with a list of numbers, it returns the largest number in the list. \n",
    "- The `print()` function in Python is a built-in function that helps display information. It can also be used to directly display the output from another function call. \n",
    "  - To display the output from another function call, make sure to place it inside a `print()` statement."
